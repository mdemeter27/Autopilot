Created by Matthew Demeter and Tyler Edwards

The goal of this project is to demonstrate our skills with arudino, PID loop, and other hardware systems.

Materials used:

LSM9DS1
Jumer T16 Pro
Frsky R-XSR

	Done
		-Have gotten teensy 4.0 to read LSMDS1(accel and mag) and sbus(receiver data)
		-Started servos. Servos respond to direct receiver control
	Next Todos
		-Set up servo calibration begining with: When mode switch from 0 to 1 or 2, have the values at that time, whcih should be centered or trim adjusted, be set as the middle values
		-setup PID
		-Make use of accel and mag data
